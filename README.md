# 2048

This is a clone I made of the popular game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) using Adobe Edge and JavaScript/HTML5/CSS.  I made this one afternoon during my work in the summer of 2014 as a side project to explore some of the additional functionality of Adobe Edge, which proved highly successful as I was then able to use several of these features in the quantum mechanics simulations, in particular the ability to include timelines within symbols.
